# Challenge One- accessibility- Adding semantic elements to a webpage

This webpage was edited to learn more about accessibility. Some tags don't explain to the browser/developer what is happening. Semantic tags can be read and be able to tell a broswer/developer what they are looking at. 

Through this challenge, I learned what makes a webpage accessibile. I researched different semantic elements. I learned different semantic html tags such as header, section, title, footer and alt descriptions. 

## Changes made
I added:
- a descriptive title explaining what this webpage is about
- a nav tag for the navigation bar
- a section for the nav bar 
- an alt="x" tag to describe the images and icons
- a footer tag for the footer
- a main tag for the body 


I also learned how to create a repository and deploy the webpage.

## Usage
